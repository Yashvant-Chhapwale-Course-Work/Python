## Day 1
### Coding_Exercise-1
 - Using `print()` Statement write a `Python Program` which gives the following Output: 
```
1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.
2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.
3. Add 3g of Salt.
4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.
5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.
```
### Coding_Exercise-2
 - Debug the following program to Print the Output without any Errors:
```
print(Notes from Day 1")
  print("The print statement is used to output strings")                 
print("Strings are strings of characters"                                  
priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")                     
print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
```
### Coding_Exercise-3
 - `Swap` the values in the variables below without manually changing their values (Hint: Use A Third Variable `temp` As A Temporary Carrier Variable For The Process):
```
glass1 = "milk"
glass2 = "juice"
```
### Day-1_Project
 - Write A Program to create a `Band-Name Generator` which takes the user's `city` and `pet` as Input and `Concatenates` them to generate the Band-Name.

## Important Concepts
 - The `print()` Function in Python is a Built-In Function used to Output Data to the Console or Standard Output Device.
 - The `" "` or `' '` are used for indicating the `String` Data Type.
 - The `+` Operator can be used for `Concatenation` of two or more Strings.
 - In Python, `Variables` are used to Store Data Values. They Act as Containers for Information that you can Use and Manipulate throughout your Program.
